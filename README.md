# Guessing game

This is a small guessing game in rust

## Usage

You need to run main typing

```
$ ./main
```

## Installation

If you want to write some rust code you need to install rust on your side

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
``` 

This will install rust and cargo which is a dependencies manager like composer

Open up a shell and type

```
rustc --version
```
and
```
cargo --version
```

You should see the version number

For more information go to [the offical rust doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/getting-started.html)

## Tips

I wrote this with vim, there is a plugin for rust [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim)
